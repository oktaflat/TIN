##### < LAB01 - LAB03 >
A small collection of projects I've done during the course with any "real" CSS work.  
I've also done some JavaScript code snippets, not showcased here (yet), which included basic FP and OOP stuff.

##### < PROJECT >
Final project for the course. Very simple (and messily written...) minesweeper game.  
No mobile support due to time constraints. ( LAB02 and LAB03 do though, if you'd like examples of that)  
It does have a JSDoc, but it's not the most readable.

As of writing this the servers are down, but normally the running version should be found [on my college's server](https://szuflandia.pjwstk.edu.pl/~s30303/index.html).

I'm proud of the visuals and by visuals I mean the main page. It's really really simple, but I think it goes well with the fact it's a minesweeper game. The buttons have a scrolling text animation, so seeing it live gives you a better impression.  
Not my *proudest* design, but it's my first time actually coding it myself and I didn't have a lot of time, so I think it's passable for it's intended purpose.
